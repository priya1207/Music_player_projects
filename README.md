ABOUT THE PROJECT
I have created a Music Player Application in Python using Tkinter and Pygame module.
In our daily life, we see every person has a hobby and that is listening to music. So in order to listen to music, they all need a Music player(hardware or software) where they can play their favorite songs. And we have to install this music player on our computer, based the Operating system i.e Windows, Macintosh, Android, Linux, etc. Then we can listen to our favorite songs.
Now we will help you to code and create a Music Player from scratch.
